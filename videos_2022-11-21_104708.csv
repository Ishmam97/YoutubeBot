HPUD1rnkw9M,UCDG_EqOaaO1SSxEMZwfrSkg,FPL GW14 - LIVERPOOL TOP 4 AT RISK! - FPL Family (Fantasy Premier League Tips 2022/2023),"City sweep aside Brighton as predicted, with Haaland also predictably, scoring twice. What was less predictable, was Pep's benching of Foden, this week's most transferred in player! We'll find out who Sam bought in on her Wildcard and whether they gave her the rank boost she was looking for.

Elsewhere, Lee laments a poor Liverpool performance, but another reasonably decent week in FPL. So what now for Salah? Is Lee going to hold for Leeds, or look to sell?

We'll also look at our teams, scores and overall ranks!
