1,op4mGRTAlEY,Daniel Gutierrez,I don’t watch futbol much but I have no idea why they would make Ronaldo come off the bench during his last World Cup. He’s one of fifas biggest icons ever he probably did a lot for the country of Portugal the least they can do is start him so he can play most of the game. Just my thoughts,0,2022-12-14T07:27:32Z,0,

They are happy to let opposing teams dominate possession but clamp down on scoring opportunities...and as soon as the other team makes a mistake they are off to the races and efficient in making the most of their counter attacks.

It was like they are amature players just learn how to cross not world class players like they are before. And some of the decisions Bruno made are questionable, instead of cross in to the box he pass low, so the defenders are easy to cut off. They run around without any plan to attack and realize only on individual moment. Ronaldo has only one chance as number 9.

It's hard to say who's better when the game is so complex. I'm just grateful for the greats and the generations they have inspired. I admit I was dreaming for a Portugal vs Argentina in the final but my hats off to the Moroccans! What a beautiful goal and a well played world cup. Straight power house not allowing ANY goals. True heart, and is why I love this game. I feel bad for the players who are retiring from every team, it brings back memories to my last days playing ball. You just never want it to end.

Even if he was perfectly neutral in his decision making that can’t happen in an event of this magnitude. Far too much money and prestige is on the line. Beyond the group stage, referees from countries that are still alive should not be working until their country has been defeated, and they can’t work a game featuring the team that defeated their country.

 Nobody, I say nobody better than you guys in this world cup and no one can stop you! Please do it for yourselves free of any pressure! Just enter each remaining match to enjoy playing your foot ball...kick the balls right and enjoy the first world cup in your hands...yall came in the right time to do the right thing and win big... 

 I stop watching football since 1998 when European  teams ganged against the Moroccan team to get us out of the world cup! 
 This game was most of the time biased to European nations! Most of the world cups were won by biases and cheats and whoever roll the tapes, can find out what I say.

 Please my beloved Moroccan team, nothing can stop you from winning this cup...you have the coach, the players, the supporters and the right time in the right wonderful country in the world: Qatar.
 May Allah be with you Ragragui and the whole team...we are satisfy no matter the result and I throw my prediction on the final:
 Croatia  vs Morocco.  0:1

2310,op4mGRTAlEY,Cristovao Miranda,"Bad Portugal strategy. They had some shots and headers with potential but played too slow like they have for 12+ years. Too much lateral passing waiting for an opening. When they went up midfielders would all hang on the edge of the box and with no opening would just pass over to the wing to pray for a good cross. It’s hard to sit back waiting for the opening when a team defends with 9 or 10 in the box. That’s why Ramos barely touched the ball and Ronaldo had more involvement when he was playing for Guerrero than when he moved into the middle after Ramos came off. The few time Morroco countered and failed, when Portugal needed a fast counter they’d stop the ball in midfield and pass around letting all the Moroccans drop back. Needed to make more of their chances on the counter instead of sitting back  and resorting to crosses once they realized there was no opening. It wouldn’t work but they didn’t adapt.",0,2022-12-10T17:54:16Z,1,['Portugal’s been sticking to this style of play forever.

Notice: A person from Morocco is called Moor.

""The Portuguese shield is one of the oldest elements of the country’s flag, with a similar shield appearing during the reign of Sancho I. The shield was only not present on a flag during the reign of Afonso I.

The shield is divided into an interior white section with 5 smaller blue shields, and an outer red area with 7 yellow castles.

The 7 yellow castles on the red part represent the 7 castles that Portugal took back from the Moors during battles. These were captured under Afonso III in the Algarve in 1249. 

The 5 smaller blue shields in the white area of the shield represent the 5 Moorish [Muslims] kings that were killed by Afonso I, the first King of Portugal. There are also 5 white dots within each blue shield representing the 5 wounds of Christ, the five wounds Christ suffered during the crucifixion.""",0,2022-12-10T17:52:48Z,0,

Somalis speak Arabic too, are you claiming they are Arabic too. No because they have a darker complexion. Egyptians tend to get their black African genetics from the Sudanese due to them sharing a boarder with Sudanese. Morocco and Algerians are more mixed with West African and Southern European genes due to their location and boarders. When Moroccan population has minimum of 20% black African genes, they are more African than Arabic. Genes have no cultural agenda to not claim their black genetic make up', '@Delboy0 we wuz portugueeeeze', '@Jaime Argudo portugal has more black players than morocco lol', '@Ruben Campos\xa0 Why do you say they do not look African?

This opens up space for other players. For instance the Felix chance, that space was open because everyone collapsed on Ronaldo the second he received the ball. Today Morocco's goalkeeper stood firm when he was called on, Portugals did not. This was the biggest difference in the match; however, it was certainly foolish not to start Ronaldo when you were not chasing a goal. Much easier to work on a pitch that isn't completely turtled up.
