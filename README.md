# YouTube Smart Tracker/Content Discovery Bot
Content Discovery Bot (CDB) for YouTube (YT). 

The YouTube Content Discovery Bot (CDB) will collect relevant data from YouTube based on various parameters, as defined/set by an analyst. These parameters could include (but not limited to): 
* keywords
* date range
* engagement score range
* seed set of videos/channels
* YouTube's own recommendation algorithm
* barcode based similar videos
* audio signal based similar videos
* text based similar videos
* suspicious score (above/below a user-specified threshold or a range)
* whether or not part of a commenter mob
* subscriptions and favorites of a channel (see image below)

The CDB will identify relevant data and populate a Smart Tracker in the VTracker application. 

A user/analyst can accept/reject CDB's suggestions and/or adjust the parameters to refine the Smart Tracker.
