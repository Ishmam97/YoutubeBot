Hq8Eo9rQgic,UCXMYxKMh3prxnM_4kYZuB3g,Bodycam Shows Phoenix Officers Shooting Suspect Armed With a Gun at a Strip Mall Parking Lot,"* (Disclaimer: This video content is intended for educational and informational purposes only) *
Phoenix, Arizona ‚Äî On November 2nd, 2022, around 4:30pm, an Officer-Involved Shooting occurred in the area of 37th Ave. and McDowell Rd. A community member called 911 and told the operators that a man identified as 29-year-old Leontae Kirk was threatening him with a gun. The caller remained on the phone and eventually told the 911 operator Kirk walked away. The caller provided a description of Kirk. Kirk with the gun walked to a strip mall at 37th Avenue and McDowell Road where he had interactions with other patrons. Kirk then went into one of the stores. The Phoenix police helicopter arrived overhead as Kirk was coming out of the store. 

The air unit relayed on the radio they spotted Kirk and indicated he had a gun and was shooting. Officers arrived on the ground moments later and located Kirk. Three officers fired their weapons and Kirk went down next to a business. The officers used a less lethal tool before approaching Kirk. When there was no response, they moved up to provide aid to Kirk until fire personnel arrived. Kirk died from his injuries on scene. The sergeant involved in this shooting has been with the department for 14 years and is assigned to the Maryvale/Estrella Mountain Precinct. The officers involved in this shooting have been with the department for 4 and 5 years respectively and are also assigned to the Maryvale/Estrella Mountain Precinct.

ZzP5DGAq1Kg,UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg,Major power outages: Displaced Ukrainians abroad urged not to return in the coming months | DW News,"Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko has given a bleak outlook for the Ukrainian capital's 3 million inhabitants, owing to the damages inflicted on the city's energy infrastructure by Russian shelling. 
""This is the worst winter since World War II,"" Klitschko told the German newspaper Bild, in comments published on Wednesday.
 Kyiv and its residents had to be ready for the ""worst case scenario"" of widespread power cuts at low temperatures, in which case parts of the capital would have to be evacuated, Klitschko warned. 
""But we don't want it to come to that!"" the former professional boxer added. Russia rained down missiles across Ukraine, forcing shutdowns of nuclear power plants and killing civilians as Moscow pursues a campaign to plunge Ukrainian cities into darkness and cold as winter sets in.
 Overnight missile strikes from Russia that hit a hospital in the Zaporizhzhia region have killed a young child, the regional governor said on Wednesday. 'Pain floods our hearts ‚Äî an infant who has just come into the world has been killed,"" the region's military governor, Oleksandr Starukh, wrote on Telegram.

wUAzOsvaX7k,UCMmaBzfCCwZ2KqaBJjkj0fw,Ukrainian Attack on Crimea and the Grain Deal - Russian Invasion DOCUMENTARY,"Kings and Generals animated historical documentary series on Modern Warfare continues with the aftermath of the first phase of the Russian Invasion of Ukraine in 2022 (https://youtu.be/yBZPE9o2gHU). Previously we talked about the build-up to the new stage of the Russo-Ukrainian War, how Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine continued, and covered events between February 24th and April 7th, as we saw how Ukraine managed to win the first phase of the war. This set up the second phase of the war - battle of Donbas. In the previous video we covered the events of April of 2022 (https://youtu.be/K2N_fHKrWIg) including the sinking of the rocket cruiser Moskva - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvB2CPpdTMY, and how the conflict turned into the war of attrition in May (https://youtu.be/D-93q4GMFT0) and continued with Russia's best month in June (https://youtu.be/SIm4mQihHdA). In the video dedicated to July - the 5th month of the war, we talked about the arrival of the HIMARS systems which strengthened Ukrainian positions and changed the war (https://youtu.be/WS0D0X8V6rg), while this video will focus on the events of August, as we will see how Russian logistics and manpower problems were worsened by the HIMARS strikes, the risk and intrigue around the Zaporizhia (Enerhodar) Nuclear Powerplant and the long expected beginning of the Ukrainian counter-offensive in Kherson (https://youtu.be/2hZoQ4xebGw). Previously we discussed the Kherson counteroffensive in the first 2 weeks of September and showed how the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kharkiv Oblast - Balakliya-Izium counter-offensive succeeded, pushing the Russians across Oskil and Lyman (https://youtu.be/gJRjKuss_Co) In the second half of September, Ukraine liberated even more territory in Kherson (https://youtu.be/S7usqwT-ty4), while this video will talk about the events of the beginning of October, including the attack on the Crimean - Kerch bridge (https://youtu.be/i4gebic_Wnc). In the second half of October, positional and attritional warfare continued to dominate, still Ukraine managed to attack the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol and the Grain Deal was almost cancelled.

We‚Äôre at it again. These are tough times. 

It‚Äôs gotten so bad that it has even taken a toll on this and it‚Äôs a big deal.   
In NYC, for decades, there was the pizza principle: where a slice of pizza was the same price as a subway ticket. 
But not anymore. The decade-long balance is now gone. 
The bad thing is that it‚Äôs much more than just pizza. 
Global chaos, rampant inflation, and a looming financial crisis. 
Crypto rose promised millions and then collapsed, taking people‚Äôs fortunes with it. 

Startups are closing down, and thousands are losing their jobs. 
Expensive pizza is the least of our problems. 
The problem is that having something to eat, like a slice of pizza a miracle for some.

 And a bigger question lingers: how do we end up in this sh*t in the first place? And, most importantly, who‚Äôs responsible? 

Let‚Äôs talk about financial crises in this episode of Company Forensics.
